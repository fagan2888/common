% List of MATLAB programs in the plotting package
%
% arrow1    - plot a nice arrow.
% date_axis - plot date in upper x axis from reading JD labels.
% draw_iline- draw line, interactively.
% errorxy   - plot two dimensinal graph with error bars on both axes.
% gno       - get handle for neastest object.
% graph     - simple plot function.
% graphedi  - graph plotting and editing (delete a point)
%             using the mouse.
% graphfit  - graph plotting with polynomial fit to the data.
% invy      - reverse the y axis on plot.
% moveobj   - move object using the mouse.
% plot3bar  - plot 3D graph with line connecting the points to the z=0 surface.
% plot_hr   - Given a set of B and R calibrated magnitudes,
%             plot a color magnitude diagram with overlayed
%             main sequence line assuming a given distance.
% plotpoly  - plot polynomial curve from coef.
% splabel   - Draw Spectral Type labeles on an axis of plot.
%             Assuming the current axis values are B-V color index.
% subplot1  - An improved subplot function.
% subplot1c - An improved subplot function, for graphical
%             display of correlations matrix.
